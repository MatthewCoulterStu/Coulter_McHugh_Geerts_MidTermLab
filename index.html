<h2>The Almighty Cube</h2>
<p>
New consoles come every few years, but sometimes it's fun to replay the classics, especially when they are remade. Most times our favourite games aren't remastered, so we have to rely on passionate modders or just stick to the old versions. With a new wave of individuals flooding into the gaming scene, legendary games have been burried or forgotton.
<br><br>
Out of all consoles, what is the most classic? Which one is most memorable and do the games still hold up? The oldest speedrunning game that is still popular to this day is Super Mario 64. The controls are a little clunky but the technical capabilities make for a skilled run. The graphics arguably don't hold up to this day though, and the level design is barren because the open worlds pushed the limits of console memory.
<br><br>
The console that sticks with me to this day is the Gamecube, but specifically for Nintendo's titles alone except for a few others. Nintendo's games from the early 2000s have a retro feel with fine details. Super Mario Sunshine, Melee, and Mario Sports games have only minor imperfections if you look very close, but the games are very optimized. The colours of most home titles are vibrant, but not over saturated to give you a warm feeling. The nature of Nintendo games with simple designs and fun voice acting make the atmosphere feel alive.

	<h2>PlayStation 2 is supperior to GameCube</h2>
	<p>In my humble opinion, PlayStation 2 is the superior system of GameCube, as well as Xbox. The Ps2 has one of the largest libraries in all of gaming, which of course you could argue is quantity over quality, but I disagree. The Ps2 is home to an abundant amount of hidden gems and underrated exclusives, as well as household names including Jak, Shin Megami Tensei, Gran Turismo, Shadow of the Colossus and many more. The Ps2 also sold the most units out of any console ever, with over 159 million units. The amount of systems sold results in an inexpensive gaming experience, which is good for both average consumers, and collectors as well.
<br><br>
Gamecube on the other hand has much less games to choose from, and is also much more expensive both for cost of console, and games. The few games that are worth playing on GameCube are usually priced around 60 dollars (im being generous with that number) and are much harder to find than Ps2 games. The GameCube is also less powerful and had fewer accessories. Furthermore, GameCube is home to a game called Super Smash Bros, which is home to the grubbiest community of gamers that have unfortunately blighted this planet. In conclusion the Ps2 is objectively the better system. Thank you.

		In conclusion, video game preference is a purely subjective thing. There are many reasons to prefer one platform over the other. It is also very important to remember that nostalgia plays a huge role when it comes to having a preference on an older system. I would recommend doing your research and listening to fans such as these two when considering which console to collect for. There is no right answer, go with the system that makes you the most excited!

	Thank you very much for reading our debate! No matter which side you stand with, as long as you are having fun collecting and playing games you have made the right choice!
